# this is not mine, just modified to fit my usage. [original](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/4072-github-repository-downloader/)
git program for computer craft

usage:
```
git <usr> <repo> <local path> <path in repo> <branch>
```
so for example to download all the files in this repo you would do
```
git popcornman209 computerCraft-git /
```
if you dont add the local path, it defaults to a downloads folder.
